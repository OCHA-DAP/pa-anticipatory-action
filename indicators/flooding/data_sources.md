### Global Flood Awareness System (GloFAS) modelled river discharge

__Description__: Daily modelled river discharge data. Provides modelled estimates of the amount of water flowing through a given river section. Average over each 24 hour period. Simulations are run based on a hydrological river routing model with modelled gridded runoff data from global reanalysis. 

__Format__: Raster. 0.1 x 0.1 degree resolution. 

__Access__: [Via API](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/cems-glofas-historical?tab=overview). 

__Coverage__: Daily global data since 1 January 1979. 

__Limitations__: Modelled, rather than historical river discharge. See [this documentation](https://www.globalfloods.eu/) for details about other GloFAS products.
