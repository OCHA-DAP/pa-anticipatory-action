## Introduction

This report provides a summary of the results and validation of an analysis of Sentinel-1 satellite imagery to estimate flood extent over time in Bangladesh from June - August 2020. This analysis is focused on flooding within five selected districts: Bogra, Gaibandha, Jamalpur, Kurigram and Sirajganj.

## Processing Sentinel-1 data to derive flood extents

In collaboration with colleagues from MapAction we took freely available European Space Agency’s [Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/user-guides/sentinel-1-sar), which provides images with 10m resolution, to estimate the flood extent over time. Sentinel-1 SAR data has been frequently applied to map flooding in past literature, even specifically in Bangladesh. In addition to being freely available, SAR imagery is particularly useful for flood mapping as it can be captured even in the presence of cloud cover, unlike imagery from optical sensors such as Landsat and MODIS. This is particularly relevant in areas such as Bangladesh which have significant cloud cover during flooding seasons. Water bodies can be identified from SAR imagery due to their dark appearance. 

The methodology used is adapted from the [UN-SPIDER Knowledge portal](http://www.un-spider.org/advisory-support/recommended-practices/recommended-practice-google-earth-engine-flood-mapping/in-detail) and applies a change detection and thresholding (CDAT) approach to identify flooded areas. A CDAT methodology for identifying flooded areas from Sentinel-1 data has been successfully applied in contexts such as Bangladesh, Namibia and the UK. We performed the analysis in Google Earth Engine, which provides easy access to Sentinel-1 data and allows for fast, cloud-based data processing. The image processing methodology described below is largely summarized from the UN-SPIDER guidance. 

The estimates of flood extent were then aggregated to a given admin unit (mauzas, in this case) by calculating the total flooded fraction within each unit for each point in time. Note that the area of permanent water bodies (as identified by the JRC Global Surface Water dataset) was removed from the area of each admin unit. The flooded fraction values thus represent the fraction of flooded area that is not normally covered by water. 

  
#### Imagery filtering and preprocessing

Available Sentinel-1 imagery for the time period of interest is filtered according to the instrument mode, polarization, and pass direction. This filtering is necessary to      ensure that mosaicked images share the same characteristics. Table 1 below briefly outlines each of these parameters. The selected imagery has already undergone preprocessing   steps to convert pixel values to their backscatter coefficient. These steps are detailed in [this page](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/sentinel1) and include thermal noise removal, radiometric calibration, and terrain correction. In addition, this methodology applies a smoothing filter to the imagery to reduce the speckle effect of radar imagery.

#### Change detection and thresholding (CDAT) to identify flooding

This methodology identifies flood extent by comparing between before-flooding and after-flooding imagery mosaics for the area of interest.  In this case, we took the average of all images from December 2019 to January 2020 from the area of interest to generate the baseline before-flooding mosaic. We also checked the EM-DAT database to ensure that there was not any recorded flooding during this period. 

The after-flood mosaic is divided by the before-flooding mosaic, with pixel intensity in the resulting image indicating the degree of change between the two images. A threshold of 1.25 is applied to generate a binary layer indicating the full estimated extent of flooding. This threshold level is taken directly from the UN-SPIDER guidance, where it was selected ‘through trial and error’. The appropriateness of this threshold level was also manually checked by comparing the derived flood extents with the after-flooding satellite imagery for selected dates. These parameters influencing this component of the analysis are summarized in the table below. 

| Parameter                    | Value                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| Non-flooded reference period | 01-12-2019 to 31-01-2020 | Following [past work in Bangladesh](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0924271620301702?), we took the median values of imagery from December 2019 to January 2020 to generate two non-flooded reference image mosaics (one each for ascending and descending pass directions). Each reference mosaic was generated using 10 images for the area of interest. |
| Flood extent threshold       | 1.25                     | From UN-SPIDER guidance, where it was selected through trial and error.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

The flood extent output is further refined to mask the main water bodies and also remove regions where the average slope is greater than 10%. Main water bodies are identified using the [JRC Global Surface Water dataset](https://global-surface-water.appspot.com/), using a threshold of areas covered by water for at least 10 months in a year. Slope is calculated from the [WWF HydroSHEDS DEM](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/WWF_HydroSHEDS_03VFDEM), based on SRTM data. 

To understand the evolution of flooding over time, we repeated this change detection process separately on all available Sentinel-1 data for the area of interest between June - August 2020. In this case, 17 mosaicked images were available throughout this time period to cover our area of interest, generating a total of 17 output Shapefiles that delineate flood extent for dates between June - August 2020.

## Modelling flooding over time with parametric curve fitting

As the temporal frequency of Sentinel-1 imagery can be up to 12 days between images, we cannot solely rely on the results of analysing this imagery to accurately identify peak flooding dates. We thus estimated flooding fraction by admin unit at daily intervals by fitting the Sentinel-1 data points to a Gaussian function. The peak of the Gaussian curve for each admin unit was then used to identify the estimated peak flooding date for that unit. This method simplifies the shape of the flooding time series and reduces the potential impacts from noise introduced by the limitations of the flooding estimates derived directly from the Sentinel-1 imagery.
