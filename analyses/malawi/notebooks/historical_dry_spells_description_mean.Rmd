### Background
<!-- Dry spell is defined as unique start date - adm2 combination -->
This is a descriptive summary of the groundtruth dataset of dry spells in Malawi that was created to inform the OCHA Anticipatory Action pilot. More information about the trigger mechanism for OCHA Anticipatory Action in Malawi or the computation of the dataset can be found [here](https://github.com/OCHA-DAP/pa-anticipatory-action).

We identified, for each district (n = 32), all dry spells that occurred during their rainy season. To do so we identified the onset and cessation date of the rainy season for each district and every year. We report on the characteristics of the rainy seasons as well as the dry spells.

```

### Data Source
We chose to use CHIRPS as data source of historical precipitation. Different data sets exist, but among those that we had access to CHIRPS generally shows good accuracy in Malawi [@zhao2019evaluating]. A caveat of CHIRPS, and many other observational precipitation datasets is that they tend to overpedict precipitation below 1mm [@dinku2011challenges,@dembele2016evaluation]. We used the CHIRPS data between 1 Jan 2000 and 31 Dec 2020 at 0.05-degree resolution.

### Definitions
Many different definitions of a dry spell, rainy day, rainy season onset, and rainy season cessation exist. The following definitions were used in the current analysis, based on literature and consultation with partners.

**Dry spells:** At least 14 consecutive days with a cumulative rainfall of no more than 2 mm during the rainy season in an ADMIN2 region.

**Rainy day:** At least 4mm of rainfall on a calendar day (DCCMS 2008).

**Rainy season onset:** First day of a period after 1 Nov with at least 40mm of rain over 10 days AND no 10 consecutive days with less than 2mm of total rain in the following 30 days (DCCMS 2008).

**Rainy season cessation:** First day of a 15-day period after 15 March with 25mm or less of rain (DCCMS 2008).

**Rainy season duration:** Rainy season cessation date minus rainy season onset (in days).

### Methodology
The CHIRPS data is released as raster data, so we aggregated this to district (admin2) level, by extracting the mean value of all raster cells whose center lied within the district.
It was chosen to compute the analysis on the district (admin2) level, since this gives a higher granularity for anticipatory actions than on region (admin1) level. Moreover, it was chosen to not go down to TA (admin3) level since the spatial uncertainty in the data is too high to predict on such a small scale.
Besides the admin level, a methodology has to be chosen to aggregate the raster cells to the desired admin level. It was chosen to use the mean of the raster cells within a district, since this allows us to detect relatively widespread events without missing events due to a small part of the district receiving more precipitation. Different methods of aggregation were tested, such as looking at the percentage of cells in a dry spell. This data is available upon request.

After we extracted the mean rain fallen within a district for every day over the last 20 years, we then computed the 10-day, 14-day, and 15-day rolling sums for each district. The earliest records in the dataset were assigned rolling sums of NA (non-applicable) until at least 10/14/15 records were available, respectively. Using these sums, the dry spells and rainy seasons were computed.

"Total rainfall" was summed over the relevant period and rounded to the first decimal.

### Rainy Seasons

We identified the onset and cessation date of every rainy season between 2000 and 2020 for each district (n = 32). Rainy seasons are labelled after the year in which they begin. Seasons that began in the Fall of 1999 and 2020 are not reported on since the dataset only had partial data for them (since the dataset did not include 1999 data and the 2020 season is ongoing). We also note that the 2020 season in certain districts had not met our onset definition by 31 Dec 2020.

                                      unique() %>%
                                      data.frame()

```

&nbsp;

#### Onsets
Based on our definition, rainy seasons started in Nov, Dec, Jan, or Feb. November and December were the most common onset months.

```{r, include = T}

regions <- rainy_seasons_detail[,c('ADM2_EN', 'region')] %>% unique()

as.data.frame(round(prop.table(table(rainy_seasons_detail$ADM2_EN, rainy_seasons_detail$onset_month), 1)*100, 1)) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = Var2, values_from = Freq) %>%
  left_join(regions, by = c('Var1' = 'ADM2_EN')) %>% # bring back regions
  rename(Region = region, District = Var1, Jan = `1`, Feb = `2`, Nov = `11`, Dec = `12`) %>%
  dplyr::select(Region, District, Nov, Dec, Jan, Feb) %>%
  arrange(Region, District) %>%
  knitr::kable(caption = "Rainy Season Onset Months (% of seasons)",
               align = c('l')) %>%
        collapse_rows(columns = 1, valign = "top") %>%
        kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"),
                      fixed_thead = T) %>%
        scroll_box(width = "100%", height = "500px")
```

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

We note significant variability in the typical onset of the rainy season by location. For instance Zomba City's onsets have been 23.4 days post 1 Nov on average while Likoma's have averaged 39.2 days post 1 Nov. The majority of districts (n = 18) had at least 1 rainy season start before the 5th of Nov (specifically, met the definition of rainy onset before 5 Nov). All districts experienced late onset rainy seasons that started 52 - 107 days after 1 Nov.

```{r rainy-onset-table, include = T}

rainy_seasons_summary_per_region %>%
  dplyr::select(region, ADM2_EN, min_rainy_season_onset_post1nov, max_rainy_season_onset_post1nov, mean_rainy_season_onset_post1nov) %>%
  knitr::kable(caption = "Rainy Season Onsets (in Days Since 1 Nov)",
               col.names = c('Region','District', 'Earliest', 'Latest', 'Mean'),
               align = c('l', 'l', 'c', 'c', 'c')) %>%
        collapse_rows(columns = 1, valign = "top") %>%
        kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"),
                      fixed_thead = T) %>%
        scroll_box(width = "100%", height = "500px")

```

&nbsp;

#### Cessations
Overall districts saw their rainy seasons end anywhere between `r min(rainy_seasons_summary_per_region$min_rainy_season_cessation_post1nov)` and `r max(rainy_seasons_summary_per_region$max_rainy_season_cessation_post1nov)` days post 1 Nov (around 15 March and 30 May, respectively). Similarly to the onset, districts varied in the typical end of their rainy season. Per district, averages ranged from `r min(rainy_seasons_summary_per_region$mean_rainy_season_cessation_post1nov)` to `r max(rainy_seasons_summary_per_region$mean_rainy_season_cessation_post1nov)` days post 1 Nov.

```{r rainy-cessation-table, include = T}
rainy_seasons_summary_per_region %>%
  dplyr::select(region, ADM2_EN, min_rainy_season_cessation_post1nov, max_rainy_season_cessation_post1nov, mean_rainy_season_cessation_post1nov) %>%
  knitr::kable(caption = "Rainy Season Cessations (in Days Since 1 Nov)",
               col.names = c('Region','District', 'Earliest', 'Latest', 'Mean'),
               align = c('l', 'l', 'c', 'c', 'c')) %>%
        collapse_rows(columns = 1, valign = "top") %>%
        kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"),
                      fixed_thead = T) %>%
        scroll_box(width = "100%", height = "500px")

```

&nbsp;

#### Durations
```{r duration-stats}
min_dur <-min(rainy_seasons_summary_per_region$min_rainy_season_duration)
max_dur <-max(rainy_seasons_summary_per_region$max_rainy_season_duration)
min_mean_dur <-min(rainy_seasons_summary_per_region$mean_rainy_season_duration)
min_mean_dur_dist <-with(rainy_seasons_summary_per_region, ADM2_EN[mean_rainy_season_duration == min(mean_rainy_season_duration)])
max_mean_dur <- max(rainy_seasons_summary_per_region$mean_rainy_season_duration)
max_mean_dur_dist <-with(rainy_seasons_summary_per_region, ADM2_EN[mean_rainy_season_duration == max(mean_rainy_season_duration)])
mean_125 <- sum(rainy_seasons_summary_per_region$mean_rainy_season_duration >= 125)
mean_125_perc <- mean_125/length(unique(rainy_seasons_summary_per_region$ADM2_EN))*100
```
Overall the shortest season stood at `r min_dur` days while the longest covered `r max_dur ` days. As for onset and cessation dates, the duration of the rainy season varied significantly per
district as well. The shortest and longest averages were observed in `r min_mean_dur_dist` (`r min_mean_dur` days) and `r max_mean_dur_dist ` (`r max_mean_dur` days). We note that only `r mean_125` (`r mean_125_perc`%) districts experienced rainy seasons lasting at least as long as the growing season for maize (125 days) every year in the period examined. 


```{r rainy-duration-table, include = T}
rainy_seasons_summary_per_region %>%
  dplyr::select(region, ADM2_EN, min_rainy_season_duration, max_rainy_season_duration, mean_rainy_season_duration, nbr_125d_seasons) %>%
  knitr::kable(caption = "Rainy Season Durations (in Days)",
               col.names = c('Region','District', 'Shortest', 'Longest', 'Mean', 'Nbr of 125+day Seasons'),
               align = c('l', 'l', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c')) %>%
        collapse_rows(columns = 1, valign = "top") %>%
        kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"),
                      fixed_thead = T) %>%
        scroll_box(width = "100%", height = "500px")


```

&nbsp;

The boxplot below shows the duration across districts per rainy season. We can see clear differences in average rainy season duration across districts between the year. Moreover, some years very different patterns were observed across districts, indicated by a longer bar.
```{r duration-boxplot, include = T,fig.height=3} 
ggplot(rainy_seasons_detail %>% filter(season_approx %in% 2000:2019), aes(x=factor(season_approx), y=rainy_season_duration)) + 
  geom_boxplot()+
  labs(title="The variability of rainy season duration across districts per rainy season",x='Start year of rainy season', y="Rainy season length (days)", fill='')
```

#### Total rainfall
The total rainfall during each rainy season was also computed per district, and can be seen in the boxplot below. Similarly to the boxplot on rainy season length, we can see differences across years as well as districts.

```{r total-rainfall-boxplot, include = T,fig.height=3}
ggplot(rainy_seasons_detail %>% filter(season_approx %in% 2000:2019), aes(x=factor(season_approx), y=rainy_season_rainfall)) +
  geom_boxplot()+
  labs(title="The variability of total rainfall across districts per rainy season",x='Start year of rainy season', y="Total rainfall (mm)", fill='')
```
### Dry Spells

A dry spell was included if at least 1 day on which the criterion was met fell during the rainy season. In other words, a dry spell was included when it overlapped with the rainy season, even if it started before or ended after it. The graph presents the occurences of dry spells over time. Each line indicates a district, i.e. the more red lines at the same time the wider the dry spell was.

#### Frequency

Over the 20-year span, districts experienced an average of **X** rainy-season dry spells. Only **X** districts (**X,Y,Z**) experienced none, and **X** experienced a dry spell every other year on average (total: 10 or 11 dry spells). Most (75%) districts experienced between **X**-**Y** dry spells.

**[TODO: Adjust WFP comparison below]**
We note a convergence between these results and the Analysis of Predictable Food Crises in Malawi carried out in January 2020 by WFP. The analysis reported on the location, frequency and impact of dry spells at the Traditional Authority (TA; adm3) level in 2011-2019. Similar findings include:

* A single district has never experienced a dry spell while 5% (n = 15) of TAs did not. That is, some areas are unaffected or rarely affected by dry spells.

* Some districts have experienced dry spells regularly. While WFP's analysis reported yearly dry spells in certain TAs, our results indicate a recurrence of once every other year at the district level.

* The two observations above indicate that districts are not homogeneously affected by dry spells. An implication is that an Anticipatory Action Trigger developed at the adm2 level should have a threshold that is sensitive to the non-uniform return period within the district not to miss shocks only happening in a subset of TAs.

* The districts in the Southern region experienced the highest number of dry spells in total (n = 86) compared to the Central (n = 56) and Northern (n = 22) regions. That is, the Southern region is more likely to experience dry spells.


#### Duration

```{r}
#[TODO: Summary of duration of dry spells]
```

#### Timing

```{r}
#[TODO: Summary of timing results]
```

This may partly be due to our definition of rainy seasons. For onset, we require that a rainy streak not be followed by a 10-day period with less than 2mm rainfall in the next 30 days for the streak. Therefore by definition the first month of the rainy season cannot have dry spells. For cessation, once rainy days become rarer the criterion for cessation is likely to be met, ending the rainy season and the window during which dry spells are included in this analysis.

The breakdown by district is shown below.

```{r ds-timing-table}

Month in which a dry spell started is a good proxy for when in the growing cycle it occurred. However it would be appropriate considering the frequent late rainy (and likely planting) season onsets to examine instead how many days in the planting season the dry spell started.

Such an analysis would require a definition of Effective Planting Start such as WFP's (two consecutive 10-day periods with at least 20mm of rain each after 1 Nov) as well as definitions of the periods when crops are most vulnerable, likely within days of planting and during flowering (how many days after Day 1 of Effective Planting Start?)

### Addendum

#### Rainy Seasons

Duration is reported in days and rainfall, in mm.

```{r addendum-rainy-seasons-detail, include = TRUE}
rainy_seasons_detail %>%
  dplyr::select(region, ADM2_EN, season_approx, onset_date, cessation_date, rainy_season_duration, rainy_season_rainfall) %>%
  arrange(ADM2_EN, season_approx) %>%
  rename(Region = region, District = ADM2_EN, Season = season_approx, Onset = onset_date, Cessation = cessation_date, Duration = rainy_season_duration, TotalRainfall = rainy_season_rainfall) %>%
  kbl(align = c('l', 'l', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c')) %>%
    collapse_rows(columns = 1, valign = "top") %>%

#### Dry Spells

The complete list of dry spells is displayed below. Only dry spells that overlapped with the rainy season are included. Duration is reported in days and rainfall, in mm.

```{r addendum-dry-spells-during-rainy-season-list, include = TRUE}

dry_spells_during_rainy_season_list %>%
   dplyr::select(region, ADM2_EN, season_approx, dry_spell_first_date, dry_spell_last_date, dry_spell_duration, dry_spell_rainfall) %>%
        arrange(region, ADM2_EN, season_approx) %>%
        rename(Region = region, District = ADM2_EN, Season = season_approx, FirstDay = dry_spell_first_date, LastDay = dry_spell_last_date, Duration = dry_spell_duration, TotalRainfall = dry_spell_rainfall) %>%
          kbl(align = c('l', 'l', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c')) %>%
