## Background
Since previous work showed that it is difficult to forecast dry spells in Malawi, this document explores the option of using monthly precipitation as a proxy for the occurrence of dry spells and the forecasting skill for monthly precipitation. 
The precipitation patterns differ per region in Malawi. Since 41 out of 44 month-admin2 combinations with a dry spell occurred in the Southern region, this analysis solely focuses on this region to prevent weakening of signals due to the differences in climates between the regions.
<!-- All the code used to produce this analysis is openly available [here](https://github.com/OCHA-DAP/pa-anticipatory-action). -->

<!-- This work uses a list of historical dry spells and rainy seasons, that was also created as part of this project. Further information and analyses of the detection of these historical dry spells can be found [here](https://github.com/OCHA-DAP/pa-anticipatory-action/blob/develop/analyses/malawi/notebooks/historical_dry_spells_description_mean.html) -->

## What is the monthly precipitation in months during which a dry spell occurred? 
The figure below shows the monthly precipitation, colored by whether a dry spell started during that month. 
From this figure we can see that 

1) Months with a dry spell do on average have less precipitation than the months during which no dry spell occurred
2) Nevertheless, many months with no dry spell also have precipitation in the same range as those months with a dry spell.

We can further divide this distribution by month. We can see that precipitation patterns clearly differ by month, which is expected. Moreover, the figures show that the separability of the occurrence of a dry spell differs by month.       
Note: during December one dry spell occurred which the plot is somehow not showing. During this month there was 170 mm of rainfall.

## What is a sensible threshold for the amount of monthly precipitation? 
In order to use the monthly precipitation as a proxy for the occurence of a dry spell, we need to set a threshold on the amount of monthly precipitation. I.e. if the precipitation is forecasted to be lower than X, we trigger and else we don't. 

One method to get a sense for this, is by investigating a range of thresholds, and for each of them looking at the percentage of months with a dry spell that are below the threshold, and the percentage of months without a dry spell that are above the threshold. This is shown in the figure below. The figure shows that there is a decent trade-off between sensitivity and specificity around a threshold of 100 mms.    
Note: there is probably a better way to visualize this

## What is the co-occurrence of <=100 mm monthly precipitation and dry spells? 
To further understand the co-occurence of low amounts of monthly precipitation and dry spells, it is important to look at the temporal distribution. To do so, the below figure shows a heatmap indicating the months with less than 100 mm of precipitation and the occurrence of dry spells. 
From this figure it becomes clear that there were 5 periods during which many districts experienced a dry spell. During 4 out of those 5 periods, there was also less than 100 mm of monthly precipitation in most of the districts. The 5th period, during January 2010, received more rain (between 140 and 160 mm depending on the district). 

Moreover, we can see that there are several events where many districts received less than 100 mm of rainfall, but no dry spell was observed. These events mainly occur during March.

## Next steps
- Discuss better method to determine threshold? 
- Get monthly forecasts and check match with observed values
