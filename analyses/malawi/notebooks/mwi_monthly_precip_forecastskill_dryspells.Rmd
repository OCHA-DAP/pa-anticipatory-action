## Questions
- is it okay to use the mean value across the admin1? 

### To do
<!-- - Remove occurrences of dry spells where <=3 adm2's within Southern region experienced a dry spell -->
- Look at each month separately
- heat map with co-occurence dry spells instead of below monthly precip

## Background
This document explores the skill of ECMWF's seasonal forecast, to predict dry spells. Bladiebla
Have leadtime 1 to 6, where 1 is the month the forecast was released. However, forecast only released on 13th of the month. 


```{r setup, include = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
source("historical_dry_spells_description_setup.R")
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE) # do not print code by default
knitr::opts_chunk$set(include = FALSE) # do not print output by default
```

```{r data-load-formatting}
data_dir <- Sys.getenv("AA_DATA_DIR") # AA_DATA_DIR is set as a variable in .Renviron or .bashprofile
plot_dir <-paste0(data_dir,'/public/processed/mwi/plots/dry_spells')
exploration_dry_spell_dir <- paste0(data_dir,'/public/exploration/mwi/dryspells/')
```

## Definitions
This analysis

- Only looks at the Southern region since almost all historical dry spells occurred in that region
- Only looks at the months of December, January, February since these months the crops are most sensitive to dry spells
<!-- - Defines a dry spell as at least 14 consecutive days with less than 2mm cumulative precipitation. The second part of the analysis compares this with a definition of at least 14 consecutive dry days, where a dry day is defined as receiving less than 4mm on one day. -->
<!-- - Includes all dry spells, regardless of whether they occurred during the rainy season or not (only relevant for December) -->
<!-- - Classifies a month as having experienced a dry spell, if at least **7** days of that month were within a dry spell -->
<!-- - Aggregates historical dry spells and monthly precipitation to admin1 (Southern region), since precipitation forecasts have too much spatial uncertainty to forecast ad the admin2 level -->
- Computes the monthly precipitation as the mean value of all cells within the admin1
<!-- - Firstly computes the occurrence of a dry spell as the mean value of all cells within an admin2. Therafter, this is aggregated to admin1 by identifying it as a dry spell if at least one admin2 within the admin1 experienced a dry spell at that time. -->
<!-- - Classifies a match between monthly precipitation and a dry spell, if they occurred during the same month **and** in the same admin1. -->

## What is the percentage of ensemble members forecasted below a certain threshold? 
The figure below shows for how many months the % of ensemble members was below 180 mm. The 180 mm was the threshold set based on overlap of dry spells and monthly precipitation analysis.

We can see that the number of months lowers as the percentage increases, which is expected. While patterns differ slightly between lead times, the pattern is rather similair. 

To set the threshold of % of members, we look at the observed data and count how many months had <=180mm. This were 21 months. We then choose the % for each leadtime which has closest to 21 months forecasted <= 180mm

## What is the miss and false alarm rate per leadtime? 
After setting the % of members, we get a list of forecasted months for which we would have triggered. Now we can compare these with the observed months with less than 180 mm of precipitation.
