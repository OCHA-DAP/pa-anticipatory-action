Framework on seasonal drought under development by the country team with guidance from CHD.

Last updated: Sep 2022

## Background information

Anticipatory action in Chad aims to preemptively respond to seasonal drought.
A trigger has been developed and proposed that makes use of a combination of
seasonal precipitation forecasts and remote-sensed Biomasse.

Moreove, an exploration of historical flooding and its correlation with hindcasts
have been done to guide discussions on the potential development of a flood trigger.
This work has its [own repository](https://github.com/OCHA-DAP/pa-aa-tcd-flooding)

## Overview of analysis

CHD provides technical guidance on developing triggers for AA and has not performed analysis for this framework's trigger. CHD has provided a risk overview for the country that can be found under `notebooks`.
