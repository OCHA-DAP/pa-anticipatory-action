## Background information

Anticipatory action in Niger aims to preemptively respond to drought. The triggers are precipitation-focused and were defined to reflect a 1 in 3 year event. A forecast-based trigger (forecasting July-August-September) is evaluated once monthly between January and June, inclusively. An observational trigger is evaluated once in early August based on the SPI for June - July.

It is monitored by IRI (through their tool Maproom) with data shared by the Direction de la météorologie nationale du Niger. and uses forecasts developed specifically for this purpose. CHD provided guidance but did not perform data analysis for this project. Forecasts, groundtruth dataset, impact data: provided by a collaboration between Direction de la météorologie nationale, AGRHYMET, IRI, WFP.
