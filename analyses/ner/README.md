## Background information

Anticipatory action in Niger aims to preemptively respond to drought. The trigger was defined to reflect a 1 in 3 year event. It is evaluated once monthly between January and June, inclusively. It is monitored by IRI/WFP (through their tool Maproom) and uses analysis developed specifically for this purpose. CHD provided guidance but did not perform data analysis for this project. Forecasts, groundtruth dataset, impact data: presented by the IRI/WFP collaboration.
