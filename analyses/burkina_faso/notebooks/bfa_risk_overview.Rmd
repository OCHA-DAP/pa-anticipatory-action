This is an initial exploration into humanitarian risks and vulnerabilities in Burkina Faso. Data is compiled and presented on the following elements: 

- [Flooding risk](https://geonode.wfp.org//layers/geonode%3Abfa_ica_floodrisk_geonode_20180712)
- [Drought risk](https://geonode.wfp.org//layers/geonode%3Abfa_ica_droughtrisk_geonode_20180712)
- [Population](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/burkina-faso-population-statistic)
- [Internally displaced persons](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/situation-des-personnes-deplacees-internes)
- [Food security](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/cadre-harmonise)
- [Poverty](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/burkina-faso-mpi)
- [Operational presence](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/burkina-faso-presence-operationnelle)
- [Seasonal precipitation forecast](https://iri.columbia.edu/our-expertise/climate/forecasts/seasonal-climate-forecasts/)

These factors vary across regions as shown by the figure below.

## Geographic overview of key factors

The North-Eastern regions of Burkina Faso (eg. Sahel, Centre-Nord) are more vulnerable, with high flood and drought risk. These regions also have a population more vulnerable to food insecurity and larger number of IDPs relative to the rest of the country. The country's humanitarian presence is also most focused on these regions.

## Tabular overview of key factors


```{r, include=T}

df_sum_display %>%
  knitr::kable(caption = "Risk, vulnerability, and capacity factors by region",
               col.names = c('Region', 'Humanitarian activities', 'IDPs (millions)', 'Multidimensional\npoverty index', 'Drought risk', 'Flood risk', 'Total population\n(millions)', 'IPC Phase 3+\n(millions)'),
               align = c('l', 'l', 'l', 'l', 'l', 'l', 'l', 'l')) %>%
        collapse_rows(columns = 1, valign = "top") %>%
        kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"),
                      fixed_thead = T)

```

## Vulnerable populations facing high hazard risk

We see a greater total population in regions facing high flooding risk. By this factor alone, we could perhaps estimate that flooding would have a larger humanitarian impact.


```{r, include=T}

high_hazard %>%
  knitr::kable(caption = "Populations vulnerable to high hazard risk (millions)",
               col.names = c('Total population','Men over 60', 'Women over 60', 'IDPs'),
               align = c('l', 'l', 'l', 'l')) %>%
        collapse_rows(columns = 1, valign = "top") %>%
        kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"),
                      fixed_thead = T)

```

## Number of humanitarian activities by cluster

This figure shows that a significant majority of humanitarian activities are within the WASH cluster, with a notable number also for Nutrition and Health.

## Precipitation forecast across Africa, April-May-June

Forecast shows potential above-average rainfall for the eastern regions and potential below-average rainfall for the western regions of Burkina Faso.
