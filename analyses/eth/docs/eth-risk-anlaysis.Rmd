This document is an initial exploration into risk of humanitarian need in Ethiopia. We're focusing most closely on climate-related risks, such as floods and drought. This document presents the outputs of basic data collection and analysis. It is intended to provide a starting point for a more in depth risk analysis for Ethiopia's upcoming Humanitarian Needs Overview. 

## Historical Analysis

Relevant datasets include: 

1. [Global Flood Database](http://global-flood-database.cloudtostreet.info/#interactive-map)
- Gridded data of historical flood extents available via [Google Earth Engine](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/GLOBAL_FLOOD_DB_MODIS_EVENTS_V1).
- Includes flood events from 2000-2018. Ethiopia has 28 events recorded.
- Events identified from the Dartmouth Flood Observatory, with flood extent mapped using MODIS satellite imagery.

2. [EM-DAT](https://www.emdat.be/database)
- Historical catalogue of both flood and drought events from 1965-2021.
- Dataset includes 74 events.
- Geolocated somewhat inconsistently to most often the Admin 1 or 2 level. 

The figure below shows the national count of shock events per year, as recorded in EM-DAT. 

```{r ts-basic, dpi=300, include=T, message= FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height=4, fig.align="center", fig.cap='National count of shock events per year'}

# Put a figure in here, for example 

plot_disaster_annual

```

The figure below shows the frquency of floods (left) and drought (right) by region since 1965. NOTE that this figure is incomplete as many past events in the EM-DAT database still need to be properly geolocated.

```{r historical-freq, dpi=300, include=T, message= FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height=5, fig.show="hold", fig.cap = 'Historical frequency of shock events by Region', out.width="50%"}

# Put a figure in here, for example 

flood_map

drought_map

```


3. [IDMC](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/idmc-idp-data-for-ethiopia)
- Number of IDPs, relating to conflict and disaster.
- Not subnational.
- Data available between 2008-2020.

4. [IOM DTM Site Assessment](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/ethiopia-baseline-assessment-data-iom-dtm)
- Assessment late Dec 2020, early Jan 2021.
- At Admin 3 level.
- For each site, includes reason for displacement and breakdown of population by age and gender.

5. [FAOSTAT Food Security Indicators](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/faostat-food-security-indicators-for-ethiopia)
- National level indicators from 2000-2020
- Such as: Prevalence of undernourishment (percent) (3-year average), Number of severely food insecure people (million) (3-year average), Percentage of population using safely managed sanitation services (Percent)

## Near-present situation

1. [Standardized Precipitation Index](https://code.earthengine.google.com/5d3600853925e070e57c9f733072e274)
- Researched in past MapAction work in Ethiopia: 

> Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) is the most commonly used indicator worldwide for detecting and characterizing meteorological droughts. It measures precipitation anomalies at a given location based on a comparison of observed total precipitation amounts for an accumulation period of interest (e.g. 3, 6, 9 months), with the long-term historic rainfall record for that period. Rainfall deficits (i.e. meteorological droughts) are indicated as SPI decreases below -1.0, while excess rainfall are indicated as SPI increases above 1.0. As SPI values are in units of standard deviation from the long-term mean, the indicator can be used to compare precipitation anomalies for any geographic location and for any number of time scales. The World Meteorological Organization has recommended that the SPI be used by all National Meteorological and Hydrological Services around the world to characterize meteorological droughts
