## Uganda Flood Risk MAM 2022
Analysis last updated on: `r Sys.Date()`

This report compiles data on the risk of flood and its potential humanitarian impact.

### Flood Risk

```{r flood_risk, include = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
#source("process_flood_risk_data.R")

```
The map below depicts flood prone areas for flood events with 10-year return period, according to the European Commission Joint Research Council. Resolution is approx. 1km and colors indicate water depth (in m).

[Think Hazard](https://thinkhazard.org/en/report/253-uganda/FL), in a collaboration between GFRR and UNMA, produced separate risk maps for river (left) and urban (right) floods. They are shown below.

### Precipitation Forecast MAM 2022

[ICPAC](https://www.icpac.net/seasonal-forecast/) issued its seasonal forecast the months of March through May 2022. On it is the overlay of boundaries for adm1 regions. The colours indicate probability that the 3-month period receives above average rainfall. Probabilities above 40 are considered high and likely. The assumption is that above-average rainfall increases the risk of flooding.

&nbsp;

![Source: ICPAC](`r icpac_image_path`)

```{r precipitation_forecast}

forecast_table <- read.csv(icpac_data_path)

forecast_table %>%
  select(ADM1_EN, mean_ADM1_PCODE, X80quant_ADM1_PCODE, perc_thresh) %>%
  mutate(mean_ADM1_PCODE = round(mean_ADM1_PCODE, 1),
         X80quant_ADM1_PCODE = round(X80quant_ADM1_PCODE, 1),
         perc_thresh = round(perc_thresh, 1)
         ) %>%
  knitr::kable(caption = "Above Average Precipitation Forecast Summary per Adm1",
               col.names = c('Region', 'Mean Probability', 'Min prob for 80% of area', 'Perc of area with at least 40% prob'),
               align = c('l', 'c', 'c', 'c')) %>%
        kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"),
                      fixed_thead = T) 

```

The four regions vary in their forecasted likelihood of receiving above average precipitation. We note that the country's north-east (yellow on the map) is the most likely to experience a particularly wet season. Note that the likelihood is not uniform within a region. Seasonal forecasts do not enable more granular projections (for example, at adm 2 or adm3). The exact location of higher probabilities (that is, yellow pixels in the image) may shift within an adm1 and/or across boundaries between two regions when it comes to actual rainfall.

The summary table report that the Eastern and Northern regions are the most likely to see above average precipitation: they have the highest average probability (ie highest certainty) over the majority of their areas (46.9 and 46.1, respectively.) They also have the largest portions of their area with a probability above 40% and considered "likely" (83.4% and 76.2%, respectively.)

For additional input, we also present [UNMA](https://www.unma.go.ug/download/mam2022-seasonal-rainfall-outlook/?wpdmdl=1059)'s seasonal forecast for MAM 2022 below.
