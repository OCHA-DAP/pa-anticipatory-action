## Getting started
If using Anaconda, set-up an environment and install the packages from `environment.yml`. 
   ``` bash
   conda env create --file environment.yml --name antact
   conda activate antact
   ```
Else install the requirements with 
   ``` bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
If an error occurs you might have to install spatialindex, with brew `brew install spatialindex`
